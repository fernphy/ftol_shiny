## Getting started

Start by selecting a species from the drop-down menu on the left.

You can also type into the search box and it will auto-complete.

### Accession

This panel shows one row per accession for the selected species. 

Columns are as follows:
- **accession**: GenBank accession number; clicking will open a browser tab with that accession in GenBank.
- **seq_len**: Length of the sequence in basepairs.

### Voucher

This panel has only one row.

Columns are as follows:
- **join_by**: Method used to join sequences across loci within the species.

### Taxonomy

This panel may have just one row if the data are the same for all accessions, or one row per accession if different accessions have different data.

Columns are as follows:
- **ncbi_taxid**: NCBI taxonomic ID for the accession (or species). Clicking on the ID number will open a browser tab with that ID in the NCBI Taxonomy database.
